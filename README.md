These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023. This year I'm starting out with JavaScript with the personal goal of trying to do a little more with visualizations, and I thought maybe I'd try to do something with React? I'm using VS Code for an IDE and Chrome as a browser environment for execution. This is my third year jumping into AoC and my first year trying it without Java. I'm also (apparently) working on infrastructure incrementally. I'm doing my best not to rewrite previous days after I finish them (despite my urges to do so), but also I'm trying to improve the overall "app" as I go, so once individual days are working under an overall umbrella of UI, I guess that can't help but make the older days look different then they did day-of. If I'm *really* ambitious, maybe I'll make UI versioning or something. In any case, the daily logs should hopefully indicate when those kinds of changes took place.

This README is part explanation, part apology, and sometimes blog.

Shoutout to the fun folks at the [Indie Game Reading Club](https://www.indiegamereadingclub.com/) alongside whom I'm doing the Advent of Code again this year! Thanks for the support and encouragement!

**Day 01 - Trebuchet?!**

I strongly considered touching this thing up before committing it, because it's a mess and because I went _way_ off the rails trying to track down and squash a bug in Part 2, but...I dunno, I'm here to learn. Took me a little bit to get my head back in a JavaScript/HTML space, but I'm starting to warm up to the environment.

**Day 02 - Cube Conundrum**

One of the rare times that I approached Part 1 in a way that ended up making Part 2 easy! Love when that happens. I also improved my development life by having the data input into the text box persist between page reloads. Hooray!
